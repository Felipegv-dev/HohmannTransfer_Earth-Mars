# HohmannTransfer_Earth-Mars
In this project I show the skills acquired in mathematics, physics and programming throughout the 3 semesters taken.
The challenge consisted of generating a simulation of how to go from Earth to Mars using the Hoffmann transfer.
In the module "HohmannTransferOrbit" I show the mastery I have in topics such as calculus, physics and numerical methods, in this case I made use of Newton's method and "odeint" given by the "scipy" python library for the solution of differential equations.
On the other hand, I generated a simulation of these orbits in order to better illustrate the situation. Thus concluding that the objective of the evaluation week was achieved
